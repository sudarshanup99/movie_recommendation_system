#Movie recommendation system
this  simple machine learning project helps you to recommend 5  movies based on cosine similarity
It is a movie recommendation system based on movie tags such as director,actor,description.
it uses the movie data and create tags from it which is in list and use sklearn count vectorizer to convert it into vector and fit transform.
Then we calculate the cosine similarity instead of eucledian distance and recommend most similar 5 movies with the help of function
This is cammpusX simple machine learning project did by me through their youtube channel.
